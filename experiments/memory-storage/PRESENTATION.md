A food ordering experience for a single restaurant. Hungry clients of this fictitious restaurant can visit its website, select one or more dishes and place an order for pick-up. They will receive a notification when their order is ready.

The restaurant and client both need to be notified since this app serves as an intermediary.

When an order is placed the restaurant receives the order via SMS. The restaurant can then specify how long it will take to fulfill it. Once they provide this information, the website updates for the client and also notifies them via SMS.

You can use a modern telecomm API service such as Twilio to implement SMS communication from the website to the client and restaurant.

For inspiration check out how Ritual works, but keep in mind that's implemented as a native app and serves more than one restaurant.

-what we built (demo)
-what you learned about project workflow
-challenges -> what you learned and/or what you will do different in final projects


1. WHAT WE CHOSE
Then we picked food ordering app because it seemed to be the more exciting of the two. Wanted to see how an external api would integrate. A restaurant page also seemed like a project that ou would often encounter in the "working world". 

2. DEMO
SETUP 
Check that ngrok url is added to twilio api on the website.
Set the time to 0.2 mins
  Visit the website
  Login
  Select one or more dishes and place an order for pick-up. 
  They will receive a notification when their order is ready.

3. WHAT WE DID
Daria twilio API implementation
70% of our work was completed on a group call (major features, design, etc.)

5. CHALLENGES 
CSS finicky - we did a lot of poking and prodding to get it to work. 

--------

4. WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT PROJECT WORKFLOW

We avoided a lot of major potential conflict with merging by working on the project together. When we did split up, we tried to makre sure we were not working on the same file at the same time as someone else. When we did make changes. We communicated through slack letting group members know a change had been pushed to the repo and that they should pull. 


6. FUTURE PROJECTS
Plan project further in advance, especially when it comes to the front-end. Make sure there is consistency in the html elements to make styling and coding easier and more efficient. 

SCSS works well. We tried to use the features it provides (variables and mixins) whenever we could.
